# Mach-O boot object without SPTM

`make` also builds `build/aura-boot.macho`: `build/aura.bin` wrapped as a
Mach-O boot object for `kmutil configure-boot` without `--raw`.

## Why

`kmutil configure-boot` records properties of a Mach-O boot object in the
boot policy. One of them, `kcbz`, is the size of the object's
`__TEXT_BOOT_EXEC` segment. macOS 27.2 iBoot loads TXM, ExclaveOS and SPTM
and enters SPTM only when `kcbz` is nonzero. With `kcbz` zero it skips that
loader and jumps to the object's entry, as it does for a raw boot object.
In this mode the GXF registers are writable, as on M1 to M3.

`aura-boot.macho` has no `__TEXT_BOOT_EXEC`, so it is meant for Macs with
M4 or later, including the A18 Pro, that would otherwise start SPTM.

## Layout

`tools/macho_boot_object.py` writes an `MH_FILESET` around the raw image:

| Segment          | Contents                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `__TEXT`         | the fileset header, at file offset 0              |
| `__PRELINK_TEXT` | the primary member's header (`com.apple.kernel`)  |
| `__TEXT_EXEC`    | the raw image, byte for byte                      |
| `__PRELINK_INFO` | prelink information with no extensions            |
| `__DATA`         | one empty page                                    |
| `__LINKEDIT`     | a chained-fixup table with no fixups              |

kmutil requires `__TEXT` at offset 0, `__TEXT_EXEC`, `__PRELINK_INFO` and
`__LINKEDIT`. `__TEXT_BOOT_EXEC`, `__DATA_SPTM` and `__RECEIPT_INFO` are
optional. Every segment is file-backed at its virtual offset, so the raw
image is loaded exactly as in raw mode, 64 KiB after the load base. The
entry point is the raw image's own entry (`--entry-point 2048` in raw mode),
and Aura relocates itself there as usual. `x16` in `LC_UNIXTHREAD`, which
kmutil 27.2 records as `kcev`, points at the vector table at the start of
the raw image.

Because the raw image is unchanged, a Stage 1 whose configuration block was
filled in (`tools/fill_stage1_config.py`) can be wrapped afterwards, or its
block can be found by its magic inside the boot object.

## Use

Wrap a raw image, then enroll it from the target volume's paired Recovery:

```sh
python3 tools/macho_boot_object.py stage1.bin aura-boot.macho
kmutil configure-boot -c aura-boot.macho -v /Volumes/<volume>
```

Check what kmutil will record before enrolling. This also runs in normal
macOS:

```sh
kmutil inspect -z -B "$PWD/aura-boot.macho" --show-mach-boot-properties
```

It must report `kcbz : 0`.

## Status

kmutil from macOS 27.2 and from macOS 26.6.2 (25G83) parses the boot
object and derives `kcbz : 0`. This build has not yet been cold-booted on
hardware, and iBoot older than 27.2, such as the 26.6.2 firmware of current
Aurora installations, has not been checked for the same behavior.
